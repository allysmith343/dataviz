From Activity 1 (Transitions): What style attributes changed smoothly? Which changes happened abruptly? 
The width and height changed smoothly. The stroke color and width changed pretty abruptly. 
Also, fourth set of bars transitioned a bit differently as it used new data.

From Activity 1 (Transitions): How might you add new data more gracefully? 
Assume that we know we will be shifting from 3 data points to 5 data points. 
You do not need to write code for this; pseudocode or words is what Iâ€™m looking for. You may consult external sources if needed.
When we have 3 data points, maybe we could have 2 blank bars, or bars that are the same color as the background. 
When we transition to 5 data points, we would just edit the 2 blank bars to be a different color so that they show up now.
I'm not sure if my explanation made sense, but I think having the space already dedicated for 2 more data points
would create a smoother transition.

How long did this take (estimate)? Around 4-5 hours.

What were the enjoyable aspects of the lab? 
I liked the family tree because it was fun to put in my family members. 
I also think my grandmas should have kept their maiden names because they're cool.

What were the challenging parts of this lab? 
I could not figure out how to flip the family tree. So, that took me a long time.

What resources did you use? 
Include links to websites below. I used the link we were given for the tool tip example. Other than that, I used previous labs.
